Open Inventor
=============

Open Inventor is an object oriented scene graph library implemented in C++
layered on top of OpenGL. It was originally developed by
[SGI](http://www.sgi.com/).

This Repository
===============

The aim of this repository is to integrate patches applied by various Linux
distributions and to apply build fixes for OS X.

It is based on an import of SGI's CVS repository at :pserver:cvs@oss.sgi.com:/cvs.
Currently, patches from Fedora and Debian are included. It also includes fixes for
font rendering on 64 bit Linux platforms.

For building on OS X, there is a [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
[formula](https://github.com/aumuell/homebrew-tap) based on this repository.
